                               May 2020 - July 2020 (3 months)
                               Learnt different concepts of Deep Learning using PyTorch from this course
                               by jovian.ml in collaboration with freeCodeCamp.org. There was a Kaggle
                               competiton at the end of this course, where I needed to predict protein
                               organelle localization labels for each sample. This is a multi-label image
                               classification problem, where each image can belong to several classes. I
                               ended up at 122nd position (top 14%) in this Kaggle competition.

                               Successfully acquired different Machine Learning skills through Python
                               from this primer course on Data Science. I finished with rank 7 out of 4770
                               participants. There was an enjoyable Capstone Kaggle Project as an end of
                               this course. The aim was to predict employee attrition by the given data about
                               his/her past history. I secured 46th rank (top 6%) in this hackathon.
